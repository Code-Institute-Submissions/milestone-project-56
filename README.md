Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Deployment

This website is a destination booking page. Where you pick a country, and view which package you want to go for. Theres 3 attractions for each package/country. You can find a demo to the website [here.](https://amit238.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

# UX

My goal in the design was to make website very easy to use website. The website only contains one page and it goes in a "step by step" order. From the title, to viewing the map, then to viewing what packages we do for each country, and then finally enquring using the contact form on what package the user wants.

Using all the skills i learnt on my last project (User-Centric Frontend) i was able to make it responsive. Javascript is also implented throughout my page. It is used to view markers on the Google Maps API
