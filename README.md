Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Deployment

This website is a destination booking page. Where you pick a country, and view which package you want to go for. Theres 3 attractions for each package/country. You can find a demo to the website [here.](https://amit238.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

# UX

My goal in the design was to make website very easy to use website. The website only contains one page and it goes in a "step by step" order. From the title, to viewing the map, then to viewing what packages we do for each country, and then finally enquring using the contact form on what package the user wants.

Using all the skills i learnt on my last project (User-Centric Frontend) i was able to make it responsive. Javascript is also implented throughout my page. It is used to view markers on the Google Maps API

# Features

##### Existing Features

* Home - User is introduced to a map to see what countries we have to offer.
* Packages - Users are able to view all the packages we are offering for each country.
* Contact Form - Users can use the contact form to email us about what country/package they would like to go for.

##### Features left to Implement

* I would like to add in the fade effect to my bootstrap cards to give it a more interactive look
* Make the markers on map clickable for users to be able view information about the selected country/city
